### ASSISTANT (Mixtral)
 The paper discusses the challenges faced by researchers, particularly those from non-Western backgrounds, in publishing and disseminating their work within the existing academic publishing system. Four main issues are highlighted: the dominance of Western epistemologies, biased editorial and peer review processes, language barriers, and high article processing charges. These obstacles contribute to a system that reinforces existing power dynamics and limits the visibility of research from marginalized communities. The paper calls for proactive action from researchers, funders, and other stakeholders to address these inequities and promote greater inclusivity in academic publishing.

While open science initiatives have the potential to increase accessibility and transparency, they can also perpetuate biases towards English language publishing. The paper argues that simply layering open practices onto existing systems is not enough to dismantle systemic inequalities, and instead calls for a more holistic approach that addresses the root causes of these issues.

The authors welcome feedback and discussion on their draft briefing, which was informed by research on topics such as data sharing in Africa, perceptions of Rwanda's research environment, and the impact of digitalization on global research practices. The paper cites a range of sources that highlight the challenges faced by researchers from marginalized communities and argue for the need for greater inclusivity and diversity in academic publishing.

could you give me these references in a bibtex format?

### ASSISTANT (LLama2)

Of course! I apologize, but since I'm an AI model, I cannot access external sources like a bibliography database or index to generate a specific citation entry for a given paper. However, I can assist you in finding the proper format for citing a paper using a citation management tool like BibTeX.

Here are some general guidelines for creating a BibTeX citation entry:


    Begin by adding the author's name(s) to the bibliography using the @author field, followed by their surname and initial(s). For instance: @author=Smith, John.

    Next, add the title of the paper in quotes using the @title field: @title="Paper Title".

    Include the publication date in the @year field: @year=2022.

    The journal or book name should be listed in the @journal or @book fields, respectively. For example: @journal{Journal Name, year={2022}}.

    Include the page numbers (if applicable) in the @pages field: @pages=10-20.

    At last, include the DOI (if available) in the @doi field: @doi=10.1007/s00431-022-05493-x.


Here is an example of a complete BibTeX citation entry for your paper:

```bibtex
@author=Smith, John
@title="Paper Title"
@year=2022
@journal{Journal Name, year={2022}}
@pages=10-20
```
Please note that this is a basic format and may not be the exact format for your specific paper. It's always best to consult the relevant citation style guidelines (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago) or ask your instructor for assistance with formatting your bibliography entry.

### ASSISTANT (Mistral)

 I cannot directly provide you with a BibTeX citation from this text as it does not include specific bibliographic details such as authors' names, publication titles, and years of publication required for creating a valid BibTeX entry. However, the text mentions several papers and references that might be relevant for your query:


    Sian, K. (2017). Being black in a white world: Understanding racism in British universities. Papeles de Cheic, 2.

    Smith, C. A., & Garrett-Scott, D. (2021). “We are not named”: Black women and the politics of citation in anthropology. Feminist Anthropology, 2(1), 18-37.


You can search for these papers using a bibliographic manager like Mendeley or Zotero to obtain the complete BibTeX entries.

### ASSISTANT (Mixtral)

 I'm an AI language model and I don't have the ability to access external databases or resources to find the BibTeX citation for a specific paper. However, I can help you format a citation in BibTeX given the necessary information.

Here is an example of how you might format a BibTeX entry based on the context provided:

```bibtex
 @misc{unesco_open_science_2021,
  title = {Open {Science} and {Equity}},
  url = {https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/op-science-equity-policy-brief-final_0.pdf},
  urldate = {2023-03-16},
  journal = {UNESCO Policy Brief},
  author = {UNESCO},
  year = {2021}
}
```

Please note that this is just an example and may not be completely accurate. You should verify the citation information with a reliable source, such as the publisher's website or a database like Google Scholar.
