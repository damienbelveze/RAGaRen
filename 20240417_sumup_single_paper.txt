 The paper discusses the challenges faced by researchers, particularly those from non-Western backgrounds, in publishing and disseminating their work within the existing academic publishing system. Four main issues are highlighted: the dominance of Western epistemologies, biased editorial and peer review processes, language barriers, and high article processing charges. These obstacles contribute to a system that reinforces existing power dynamics and limits the visibility of research from marginalized communities. The paper calls for proactive action from researchers, funders, and other stakeholders to address these inequities and promote greater inclusivity in academic publishing.

While open science initiatives have the potential to increase accessibility and transparency, they can also perpetuate biases towards English language publishing. The paper argues that simply layering open practices onto existing systems is not enough to dismantle systemic inequalities, and instead calls for a more holistic approach that addresses the root causes of these issues.

The authors welcome feedback and discussion on their draft briefing, which was informed by research on topics such as data sharing in Africa, perceptions of Rwanda's research environment, and the impact of digitalization on global research practices. The paper cites a range of sources that highlight the challenges faced by researchers from marginalized communities and argue for the need for greater inclusivity and diversity in academic publishing.
